# Gmail App Password Guide for Starry Comics

## Why You Need an App Password

When using Gmail with 2-factor authentication (2FA), you need to generate a special "App Password" for 
applications like Nodemailer that don't support Google's modern authentication flow.

## How to Generate an App Password

1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Select "Security" from the left navigation panel
3. Under "Signing in to Google," select "2-Step Verification" (You must have this enabled first)
4. Scroll to the bottom and select "App passwords"
5. Give the app password a name (e.g., "Starry Comics Email")
6. Click "Create"
7. Google will display a 16-character password - copy this password
8. Add this password to your .env file as EMAIL_PASSWORD=your16digitpassword

## Important Notes

- Do NOT use your regular Gmail password - it won't work with 2FA enabled
- App passwords don't have spaces when you add them to your application
- Each app password can only be viewed once when created
- You can revoke app passwords at any time from the same screen
- Keep your app passwords secure - they provide access to your account

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Make sure your EMAIL_USER value is your complete Gmail address (e.g., example@gmail.com)
2. Check that the password is copied correctly without spaces
3. Make sure Gmail's SMTP service isn't blocked by any network settings
4. Try revoking and creating a new app password
5. If using a Google Workspace account, make sure app passwords are allowed by your admin
